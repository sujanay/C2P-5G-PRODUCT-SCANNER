# Accomplishments (07-29-2018 to 08-03-2018)
1. **Open the port of Google's preinstalled deep learning virtual machine**
      > Created new virtual machine (VM) with Google's preinstalled deep learning image, and opened the required port of VM for running jupyter notebook.
2. **Image augmentation**
      > Image augmentation works for rotating images of desired angles
      > Image augmentation script works for images in different folder.
3. **Combining all images to train, test, validation file (TFRecord)**
      > Was able to write all the iamges to a single TFRecord file
4. **Choosen viable NN parameters to the GUI**
      > Have collected the list of promising NN parameters that can be integrated with GUI. The list is in [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fPu8Y-Cls-oBzXKpCR39aSajzzjnfz4uet_YfZwMLdQ/edit?usp=sharing).
5. **Created Bucket in Google Cloud**
      > Created [bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/c2p-bucket?project=g-product-scanner-sujan) in GCP to store large files and easily curl the files into google cloud virtual machine.  
6. **Done Error analysis for incorrect prediction**
      > [Error analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yd1_qph3sVW1ufe-LCqP7HjoL-BQmDwnUJEX9OILDwQ/edit#gid=0) and confusion matrix is constructed for performance analysis. 


# Next Steps
1. **Open custom port for tensorboard visualization**
      > Open port 6006 for visualizing training/validation error(loss) and accuracy.
2. **Save the model** 
      > Save the model for each and every training so that it can be used to make prediction and evaluate performance of the model
3. **Have to work on reading files from single TFRecord file (in future for custom model)**
4. **Perform image recognition for more product categories (may be 20 products with image augmentation)**
