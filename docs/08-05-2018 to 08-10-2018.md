# Accomplishments (08-05-2018 to 08-10-2018)
1. **Added Graph in Jupyter Notebook**
      > Added [graph](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization_1.html) to visualize training/validation loss/accuracy in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Save and load model**
      > The Jupyter Notebook file now has code to save and load the trained model to make predictions later.
3. **Improved accuracy**
      > Few model configuration is changed, and trained with the original dataset.
      > Number of errors was 0/24 test images. [Link to results](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization.html)
4. **Trained with different training parameters**
      > Trained the model with different values of epochs and dropout rate to reduce high variance issue.
5. **Prediction results for different model**
      > 1. [Prediction with visualization 40 epochs 0.5 dropout without correct predictions](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization_1.html)
      > 2. [Prediction with visualization 500 epochs 0.5 dropout with correct predictions](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization_08_12_2018.html)
      > 3. [Prediction with visualization 1000 epochs 0.8 dropout without correct predictions](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization_0.8_dropout_2000_epochs.html)
      > 4. [Prediction with visualization 1000 epochs 0.8 dropout with correct predictions](http://storage.googleapis.com/c2p-bucket/product_classifier_with_visualization_with_correct_predictions.html)
      
# Next Steps
1. **Save model with checkpoint**
      > Save the model checkpoint to be able to resume training from where it left (for some unexpected reason).
2. **Link Python Backend with GUI**
      > Link the image recognition model at the backend with Java GUI.
