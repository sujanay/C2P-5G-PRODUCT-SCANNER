# Accomplishments (08-12-2018 to 08-17-2018)
1. **Save the model checkpoint**
      > The checkpoint of the model (in training) can now be saved at each epoch so that the training can be resumed later if for some  unexpected reason the training is interrupted.
2. **Separate training and testing**
      > The training and testing process can be done independently 
# Next Steps
1. **Train and Test model for more brands**
